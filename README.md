# Custom Neural Network

This repository implements a neural network with some layers from scratch, using Numpy only.

Currently, we have the following layers:
- Affine (Dense)
- ReLU
- SoftmaxWithCrossEntropy

To run the neural network, simply use main.py as a script from the command prompt. (Note: You must have data in the working directory).

Each of these layers is implemented as a class that has both forward and backward methods, enabling forward and backward propagations.

We plan to add more layers including:
- Batch Normalization
- Conv2D
- RNN
- Dropout
